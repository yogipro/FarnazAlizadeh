<h3>Abstract</h3><br/>
We have investigated the effect of Cu dopant and substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties of ZnS thin films deposited on glass substrate by spray pyrolysis technique. The glass substrate temperature varied from 300 to 450 °C. Different characteri- zation methods such as X-ray diffractometry, EDS, SEM, and Raman scattering analyses for studying the structural, morphological and optical properties of the prepared ZnS and ZnS:Cu samples were carried out. Improvement in crystallization, increase in crystallite size and also better growth orientation along the (111) direction are clearly evident due to the increase in the substrate temperature. Cu doping effects on the displacement of dif- fraction peaks towards larger angles and decrease in crystallite size which caused by this impurity are the main results of this studies. The absence of any other impurity in sam- ples, smooth surface, homogenous structure and spherical shape of crystals have approved by EDS analysis and SEM imagining, respectively. Raman scattering spectra of ZnS and ZnS:Cu in ambient condition not only indicate E and A Raman first order scattering of ZnS, but also indicate an intense peak about 334 cm−1 related to surface optical phonon mode in this nanostructure. Optical properties of thin films determined by UV–Vis spec- troscopy and the energy band gap was calculated with ZnS doping rates. Photolumines- cence analysis and origin of green emission peak at 533 nm and red peak at 745 nm were discussed.<br/><br/>

<h3>1 Introduction</h3>
Extensive studies have been made on semiconductors of group II–IV and zinc sulfide is known as one of the most important semiconductor materials due to its extraordinary characteristics such as non-toxicity and having one of the largest energy band gap (about 7.7 eV) in this group. The large energy band gap causes emitting photons with higher energy and better light absorption. So ZnS has many applications in making electronic gadgets such as LEDs, field effect transistors (FETs), gas sensors, thermal sensors, biosen- sors, and solar cells (Ahmad and Ahmed 2016; Kennedy and Murmu 2014). Among the compounds of group II–IV, zinc sulfide is more stable in chemical terms and therefore is a suitable host for various dopants. So far, intermediate metals have been deposited in differ- ent zinc sulfide nanostructures (Peng et al. 2006). The combination of ZnS and CuS with a narrow band gap (~2.2 eV) can make up for the defects of a single compound and signifi- cantly enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity (Kaur and Sharma 2015). Synthe- sis conditions and dopant concentration are the key factors that change certain properties in semiconductor nanoscale structures. Therefore, understanding the role of the dopant on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of nanostructures of doped semicon- ductors is very important. Spray pyrolysis is a promising process in scientific research for the preparation of thin and thick films, ceramic coatings and powders. Unlike many other film production methods, spray pyrolysis offers a relatively simple and inexpensive process (especially in terms of the cost of device equipment). Layered films are also easily prepared using this technique. Spray pyrolysis involves several processes, either simultaneously or in order. The most important of these are the production of aerosols and transitions, the evaporation of the solution, the effect of dripping the subsequent droplets, and the propa- gation of the particle. The surface temperature at all stages, except for aerosol production, plays a decisive role, and the surface temperature under the layer is the most important parameter in determining the morphology and physical properties of the produced film. As the temperature rises, the morphology of the film may change from a micro-structured to porosity. Changing the temperature of the substrate can have a significant effect on the optical and electrical properties of the ZnS film. Ramen spectrometry is a very effective way of studying the materials structure, how the composition and dynamics of the surface layer of powders and thin films are (Scherder and Kiefer 2001). By analyzing the peak of the spectrum, a good recognition is obtained from the vibrational properties of the materi- als and the transport features and phonon interactions with free electron carriers. Achiev- ing this information can be very useful because it leads to understand the efficiency and the role of optoelectronic components. In the polar conduction channel, the carriers propagated to the conduction band through the interaction of the Froehlich with longitudinal phonons (LO) are transitioning to the base state. The second-order Raman effect in ZnS is analyzed from the empirical work and the rules for the choice of theory in three of the most impor- tant points of critical symmetry (X, L, W) at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (Nilsen 1969). The two general rules for selecting two-photon Raman dispersion in crystals with a long zinc structure are as follows: (1) All possible acoustic and optical combinations of two phonons and overtones are allowed Raman modes at X, L, W points. (2) Most of the overtones and compounds except the compounds at point X have an A1 symmetry (Birman 1963). The selection rules for the dispersion of two phonons in the crystals with the wurtz- ite structure are as follows: (1) Overtones always have the A1 symmetry, while the compo- sitions belong to a variety of unmatched displays that never contain A1. (2) By reducing the point symmetry in the area of the Brillouin area, the number of overtones and hybrid modes will increase. (3) The consequence of the atomic arrangement of wurtzite in com- parison with the zinc blend is the placement of the Brillouin area along the cubic (111), due to the folding of the phonon branches at the new boundary of the region. Studies on the ZnS Ramen dispersion have expanded since the 1960s (Schnider and Kirby 1972; Ser- rano et al. 2004). However, the analysis of ZnS:Cu by spray pyrolysis method has not been reported yet. In this study, we investigate substrate temperature changes in the range of 300

<h2> Experiments</h2>
First, thin layer of pure zinc sulfide was deposited by spray pyrolysis technique. The pro- cess was carried out using a local made spray pyrolysis machine on a glass substrate with the dimensions of 3 × 2 cm2. Prior to the deposition, substrates were cleaned up by acetone, HCl and distilled water, respectively, for 15 min for each cleaning process and then dried up by the wind pump in order to remove all contaminants on the surface of substrates. 0.1 M of zinc acetate (Zn (CO2CH3)2 (H2O)2) with 99.9% purity and 0.2 M of thiourea (SC (NH2)2) with 99.9% purity purchased from Merck Co. were dissolved in distilled water individually and mixed with magnetic stirrer for 30 min. Afterwards two solutions were mixed with a magnetic stirrer for another 30 min (molar ratio of Zn2+ to S2+ in mixture was 1:2). The layers were sprayed at substrates temperature varied in the range of 300 to 450 °C and the spray rate of 6 ml/min. The distance between the nozzle and the substrate was 30 cm. The final solution was sprayed on the substrate for 45 min. In the next step, thin layer of ZnS:Cu was synthesized. For this purpose, after purifying the glass substrates in the previously mentioned method, in addition to the 0.1 molar acetate solution and 0.2 molar thiourea, the copper acetate solution (Cu (CO2CH3)2 (H2O)) with 2 wt%, were pre- pared in the same manner as before.<br/><br/><br/>
<h3>3 Results and discussion</h3>
<h4>3.1 Structuralproperties</h4>
<h3>3.1.1 XRD analysis</h3>
X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized ZnS and Cu-doped ZnS films are pre- sented in Fig. 1, which are deposited in three different substrate temperatures (300, 400 and 450 °C). Two distinct peaks at 2θ=28 and 48° are presented. All the diffraction peaks of films which are synthesized with a substrate at 450 °C, have higher resolution, which cor- responds to the (111) and (022) planes, respectively, and can be well indexed as the cubic blend structure which are consistent with the JCPPS card number 01-080-0020.<br/>

 For two substrate temperatures below 450 °C according to Figs. 1 and 2, the structure of the synthesized films is more amorphous, and in this temperature the improvement in the crystalline structure is evident with the sharpening of the peaks. The existing of a dominat- ing peak is an indicator of high preferential orientation. The intensity of the peaks indicates a relatively large size of nanoparticles. It can be concluded that the synthesized films have a strong preferential orientation along (111) direction without any additional annealing process. The average crystallite size was determined by the Scherrer equation as follows (Cullity 1956):<br/><br/>
D= 0.9𝜆 𝛽cos𝜃<br/><br/>
where λ is the X-ray wavelength (copper Kα), θ is the Bragg angle, and β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM).<br/><br/>
 D =

180
(
28.87 2
) = 140 Å ≈ 14 nm<br/><br/>
   Increasing of the reaction temperature (substrate temperature) leads to grain growth and an increase in the crystallite size. Lattice parameter (a) of the cubic structure can be calcu- lated from the following formula (Cullity 1956):<br/><br/>
1 =h2+k2+l2 d2 a2
hkl<br/><br/>
where dhkl is the distance between the Miller’s indexes h, k, and l. The cubic ZnS lattice parameter was estimated to be 5.135 Å (Chalana et al. 2016), which is in excellent agree- ment with the reference. One possibility is that by increasing substrate temperature, the amount of sulfur (S) is reduced. It can be explained that the higher the temperature rises, the greater the probability of the interaction between the ZnS film and the substrate oxygen is, and ZnO is formed by substituting O in S, so this causes reduction in S content. But the absence of intense ZnO peaks in the present study can be due to an increase in the initial concentration of sulfur in the precursor contents, which does not allow the substitution of O2− in S2−.<br/>

homogeneous form of nano sized structures that are relatively spherical nanoparticles and correspond with the result obtained with the Scherrer equation (Figs. 4, 5).<br/>
In order to study ZnS film doped with copper and its effects on the structural properties of the synthesized films, The XRD pattern of the doped sample is shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. As can be seen, in addition to the main peak of the (111) lattice reflection plane, which appears at a smaller 2θ than the un-doped sample, there is a displacement of 2θ from 27.88 for the un-doped sample to 28.18 for ZnS:Cu sample. Bragg diffraction effects from other planes, such as (110) and (311) also observed.<br/>
Generally speaking, X-ray peak red shift occurs due to these three reasons: lattice parameter change, presence of residual stress and defect concentration. It is well known that Cu+ can be substituted for ZnS2+− ions in the ZnS crystal lattice because of their close ionic radii of 0.74 Å 0.77 Å for Zn2+ and Cu+, respectively (Bouznit et al. 2014). Due to the Zn2+ smaller ionic radius than Cu+, the possibility of substituting Cu+ ion instead of Zn2 + in the ZnS lattice could be responsible for this shift at Bragg’s position for the peak (111) the crystallite size was estimated 14 nm from Scherrer’s equation which is reduced in comparison with the un-doped sample crystals. Reduction in crystallite size by adding<br/>

dopants have been reported previously. The decrease in the crystallite size with respect to the doping effects the possible obstruction of crystalline growth by the presence of foreign atoms (Kalirajan et al. 2015). Lattice parameter calculated for the synthesis with the sub- strate temperature of 450 °C, which is 5513/0 is slightly higher than the un-doped sample in the same conditions and the synthesis temperature. Which is possible due to the larger ion radius of Cu+ than Zn2+, substituting Cu+ ion instead of Zn2+. It is also natural that in this situation the balance of electrical charge is disrupted and the possibility of oxidation of ZnS in these conditions is low since Due to the smaller ion radius of O2− than S2−, the lat- tice parameter should be smaller, 2θ should be shifted towards larger angles.<br/><br/><br/>
